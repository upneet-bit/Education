          Institutions are sometimes confused with organisations. One can think of the differences between them in this way: 
          ‘If institutions can be defined as the “rules of the game”, organisations are how we structure ourselves to play’. 
          Organisations are shaped by institutions, and in turn shape institutional change. 
          Organisations are the material expressions of institutions circumscribed by 
          ‘groups of individuals bound by a common purpose’
